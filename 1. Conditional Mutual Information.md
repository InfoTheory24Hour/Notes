#### Reconstructing the phase space / attractor

[Distribution of Mutual Information](http://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0011016.pdf)

**Comment:**  

[Takens' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takens%27_theorem) points out that the chaotic dynamics / attractors can be reconstructed by the time series of observations. The **mutual information** can give us the hint to find the optimal choice of time delay.

**Important applications** : Equation-Free Prediction

### Question:

1. How to understand the Von Neumann entropyï¼Ÿ
    - What's the relation between the Von Neumann entropy and the transmission matrix?

2. The Shannon theorem, namely the Noisy channel coding theorem.
    Is the limit of rate caused by a math constraint or a physics constraint?
